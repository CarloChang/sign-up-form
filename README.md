### Goals

- The idea is to replicate the given image above, just to make thinks different I will translate everything to Spanish
- Utilize forms, styling them with CSS whenever the user introduces an input and checking with JavaScript that everything works as intended

### What I have learned

- How forms are used in webpages
- How to link them with JS
- Make the forms work with certain conditions
- Use a custom validation aside from the default from HTML5 by using JS as replacement
